# My iOS Shortcuts

> Just some shortcuts for iOS I wanted to share.

Thanks for checking out my first attempt at shortcuts and GitHub! So far, I have a few that I‚Äôve made. The first two I'm sharing I made for when I drive for Uber. When I accept a new passenger I always find myself doing the same tasks so I set these up to automate the process. The music one I made to make a QR code for songs in apple music, for sharing with friends and for my DayOne journal, hopefully, DayOne shortcuts coming soon!

## Installation

You can download this repo to [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8) and open the binary file using the sharing option (I find the best luck from the Files app) or click/copy the iCloud URL to open in Shortcuts.app and save to your device. I've added `.toml` files, where available, which can be used with [python-shortcuts](https://pypi.org/project/python-shortcuts) in case you want to customize, edit or borrow snippets for use in a text editor and compile them yourself!

## Shortcuts:

### Signing Online - Uber

**Siri command:** "Hey Siri, I have a passenger"  
**What it does:** Plays Duran Duran Radio, Toggles DND on, sets display brightness to a generally tolerable level (except in bright sunlight), sets system volume to high and launches the Uber Driver app in case you had a different application open. I updated the shortcut to toggle WiFi off because when connecting to an open network, (say the phone connects to a Starbucks when at a light) trips may fail to accept while your phone may not have disconnected from the network yet and lose the ride.

### Signing Offline - Uber

**Siri command:** "Hey Siri, no more passengers"  
**What it does:** Plays podcasts, toggles DND off and opens Waze, my preferred navigation app.

_Note: ~~Shortcuts doesn‚Äôt currently have a glyph for Uber so I used the Pied Piper symbol cuz it makes me chuckle and I love the show Silicon Valley~~ Sadly Apple seems to have removed the icons of popular brands üò¢_

## Backup Shortcuts

### Zip to iCloud or Dropbox

Gets all your shortcuts & creates an archive with the title `Backups-<date>.zip` and saves them in either iCloud or Dropbox. Especially handy for quickly transferring to your computer so mess with python-shortcuts and Shortcuts JS with!

## Music Shortcuts

### Armin Only

**What it does:** Offers a menu to play studio albums by the legend himself, Armin Van Buuren! Also includes a few Universal Religion compilations. All links are to Apple Music for now. This was an easy shortcut to get some practice with the `toml` format üòâ. A much larger one coming soon offering options of every ASOT mix compilation! Stay tuned!

### üé∂ Generate QR Code for Currently Playing Track üéß

**What it does:** What the title says. I started with the apple shortcut to get the URL for a playing track and worked with it to create a QR code for easy sharing and to add to my journals in DayOne.

## _in-progress_

### README-Gen

**What it does:** Prompts you for input to generate a basic `README.md` file for your project! It's pretty basic for now and will work on setting more customizations and support for initializing into WorkingCopy.
