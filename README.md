# My iOS Shortcuts

> Just some shortcuts for iOS I wanted to share.

Thanks for checking out my first attempt at shortcuts and github! Sofar, i have a few that ive made.  The first two im sharing I made for when i drive for Uber.  When I accept a new passenger i always find myself doig the same tasks so i set these up to automate the process. The music one I made to make a qr code for songs in apple music, for sharing with friends and for my DayOne journal, hopefully DayOne shortcuts coming soon!

## Shortcuts:

### Signing Online - Uber

**Siri command:** "Hey Siri, I have a passenger"
**What it does:**Plays Duran Duran Radio, Toggles DND on, sets display brightness to a generally tolerabble level (except in bright sunlight), sets system volume to high and launces the Uber Driver app in case you had a different application open.

### Signing Offline - Uber

**Siri command:** "Hey Siri, no more passengers"
**What it does:** Plays podcasts, toggles DND off, and opens Waze, my preferred navigation app.

_Note: Shortcuts doesn't currently have a glyph for Uber so I used the Pied Piper symbol cuz it makes me chuckle and I love the show Silicon Valley ðŸ˜Š_
